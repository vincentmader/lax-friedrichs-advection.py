* Lax-Friedrichs integration of the advection-diffusion equation

*** Influence of parameters
- $a>0$ $\Rightarrow$ Solution is shifted to the right.
- $a<0$ $\Rightarrow$ Solution is shifted to the left.
- $|a|\gg1$ $\Rightarrow$ No advection, only diffusive effect.
- $|a|\ll1$ $\Rightarrow$ Scheme becomes unstable.
